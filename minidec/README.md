## MiniDec - Quick R2 - Decompiler debug tool

To use this build the entire repo with `cargo build`. This will create a build
of `minidec` in ./target/debug/minidec.

To use with r2, open a bin in r2 using the usual r2 option. Then use r2pipe
to run minidec as:

`#!pipe <path/to/minidec>`

This will analyze all the functions in the binary and will annotate the
functions with a comment to the file that contains the IR for the function.
You can open the same by seeking the the required function in visual mode and
using ",".

In case of errors/panics, please open an issue on github. It would be helpful
to attach the complete output and backtrace to the issue. A backtrace can be
generated by running minidec as:

`#!pipe RUST_BACKTRACE=1 <path/to/minidec>`

If the binary can be distributed, consider attaching a copy of the same.

Thanks!
